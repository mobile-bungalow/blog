excerpt: Linkedin is the bizarre newest victim of a homoegnizing social media landscape. In a twist approaching satire, Linkedin has begun adopting a Tik Tok like format - raising questions about the our ability to communicate and organize in an attention economy arms-race.

<p class=fig_caption>Linkedin has added animated profile pictures for professional reasons.</p>

I have a compulsive tick that causes me to check Linkedin. Every four to five minutes I open Linkedin for less than a second and close it. It is  the only social media I afford myself, I know my vices. Nothing has happened on linkedin, I can guarantee that. When I joined it it was a symphony of self congratulatory virtue posts alongside envy provoking milestone snapshots, held together with the Elmer’s glue of recruiter capital. It was the kind of thing that tempts a man to use words like “hyperreality” and “spectacle”. Dear reader, I am tempted. 

 A month or two ago something changed. My feed was filled with somatic stimulation content from accounts I had no connection to. I need to emphasize the nature of this change because no one seems to understand how dramatic it is. My feed went from content made by first and second order contacts, usually milestones or reposted articles, to almost entirely 15 to 30 second videos of building demolitions, honey being poured into jars, sped up lathe footage, and videos of skilled laborers working at a fast pace, often times with subtitles in hindi or mandarin. 

It’s hard to speculate what the set of discussions that led to this complete departure from Microsofts’ previous content strategy must have looked like. Maybe someone decided that the new metric to Goodhart on was engagement? This seems unlikely because of Linkedin’s profit model which is mostly based on recruiter and job-seeker subscriptions. Ads are rarely shown on linkedin and usually only industry culture propaganda. Maybe someone decided that this was a good way to make the website legible to a new wave of young graduates looking to network. This seems unlikely, given that being distracting and participating in an attention economy arms race directly defeats the purpose of a professional networking site. Barring an extremely patronizing view of young talent, reorganizing the site this way would be hard to interpret as anything besides antagonistic to their early career advancement.

Why is Linkedin becoming TikTok? This development seems in keeping with other Microsoft hair trigger adaptations. When the Ipad was released, Microsoft reorganized their flagship operating system around a tablet form factor. When VR was oversold during the pandemic, they added 3D integration to many of the office apps. When Java made Sun Microsystems too big to fail Microsoft released C#, a Jit compiled language with nearly the same feature set as Java. In this light, the decision to reformat Linkedin into an engagement-baiting, ML driven feed does not appear to be a coherent local strategy, but is instead in keeping with Microsoft overfitting industry trends.

Social media platforms used to differentiate in the ways that most venues do. In whom they cater to, in their modes of exclusion, and in the kind of communication they are built to facilitate. In meatspace, it does not matter how popular stadium-cheese-filled mini sliders have become, the wine bar will not serve them. In this same way early web forums did not allow off topic incursions into long running threads. Content moderation is medium hygiene. The contextual collapse of all social media platforms into one paradigm is simply put: unhygienic. The carcinization of all platforms into slot machines defeats their purpose, their uniqueness, and I believe represents a serious ecological hazard to our ability to organize and be culturally productive. I think It’s important for social media users to be conscious of cultural shifts on the platforms they use, you vote through your surveilled actions. If no one leaves due to vendor lock in, in Linkedin’s case essentially career blackmail, then the vendor will continue to make decisions which cheapen the quality of communication on the platform until it is unusable. Centralized eternal September. Maybe it’s time to refuse Linkedin, more generally: refuse social media which fails to specialize, which fails to give us back our attention.
